Hi, I’m @ThatColdToast
I am mostly a java developer in High School. I like to work in many other languages though. I love learning new languages and am still learning many things about all of them.

I have worked with and feel the most fluent in these (that I can think of):
- Java
- C#
- C++
- Kotlin
- GLSL
- HLSL

I'm still learning the following languages:
- Rust
- Python

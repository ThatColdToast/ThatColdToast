Hi, I’m @ThatColdToast
I am mostly a java developer studying Computer Science in University. I like to work in many other languages though. I love learning new languages and am still learning many things about all of them.

I have worked with many languages, here are some of them (ranked for fluency):
- Java
- Kotlin
- C#
- C++
- Rust
- GLSL
- HLSL
- Rust
- Python
